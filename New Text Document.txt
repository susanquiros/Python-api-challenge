Through the linear regression we can observe that on avergae Max temperature is directly 
related to the Latitude by 66.5% regardless of the hemisphere in which it is located.
however, the southern hemisphere (67%) wins by 1% in comparisson with the northern(66%). 
Adittionally, the linear regression helps us to understand that the other variables in 
the model: humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed are not affected by a change in latitude regardless od its hemisphere.
